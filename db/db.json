    {"Name":"Sounds Of Speech", "Date":"2013-14",
    "About":"This application was originally created in Flash 12 years ago and has been the most popular phonetics application on the web. I managed a student employee in the conversion process of the Flash animations to use png spritesheets. I rewrote the code to use HTML5 web standards. The final product is called Sounds of Speech and is the first commercially sold application by the University of Iowa in iOS and Android app stores. PhoneGap is used to create a native mobile application.  It uses animations, video and audio of the proper articulation to produce the sounds of English" ,

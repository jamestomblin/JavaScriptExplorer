Qualifications:

Interaction Design equally balances the needs and theories of Graphic Design, Computer Science, and Human Psychology. During the past 20 years I have acquired a practical and academic approach to Interaction Design based on my experience and education of these three disciplines. I’ve received a Bachelor in Studio Art from the University of Iowa with a minor in Computer Science and a Certificate in Computer 3D Modeling.  For 2 years I utilized my artistic skills while working for Flight Safety Boeing creating 2D and 3D computer graphics for training software. While in Seattle I received a Certificate in Game Design from the University of Washington.  I went on to receive a Masters in Education focused in Instructional Systems Technology from the Indiana University. There I studied the learning sciences from the leaders in the field and learned how people use and interact with technology to achieve a learning goal.  During my time in graduate school I worked for two education focused startup companies where I designed and developed e-learning software, games and simulations, and explored new technologies such as augmented reality.  I then came back to the University of Iowa to work as an Application Developer focused on enabling faculty to use digital media for education and developing educational applications.  Since then I have been a part of many projects at eh University of Iowa that help students learn using a variety of technologies ranging from rich media applications, virtual reality and mobile applications. I feel I have a unique and balanced approach to Interaction Design that synthesizes multiple disciplines in order to produce thoughtful digital experiences for people.

Teaching Philosophy:

I am a strong believer in Problem Based Learning in a constructivist environment.  Design and Development requires higher order thinking that focuses on breaking the problem into achievable parts and putting them back together in a systematic organized fashion.  Because of my constructivist philosophy I favor an environment in which students have the freedom to make mistakes and not be punished for attempting difficult tasks. The most challenging part of most design problems is choosing one of many paths. Thoughtful designers can explain why they have chosen an approach to a problem. In an academic environment a student’s explanation and afterwards reflection can be a valuable as a piece of the assessment. While in the real world designers must know their limitations and understand the consequences of their decisions, in an academic environment a student can learn their limitations in a safe environment. This philosophy places the instructor in a facilitator role, providing guidance to the student.  This approach allows the students to become self-directed learners.
